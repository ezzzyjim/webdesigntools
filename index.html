            chart. Two singles from it were hits: Heartbreaker and We Live for

        <h3>Growing up Benetar</h3>

        <p>
          She became interested in theater and began voice lessons, singing her
          first solo at the age of eight, at Daniel Street Elementary School, a
          song called "It Must Be Spring".At Lindenhurst Senior High School
          (1967_1970), she participated in musical theatre, playing Queen
          Guinevere in the school production of Camelot, marching in the
          homecoming parade, singing at the annual Christmas Tree Lighting
          ceremony, and performing a solo of "The Christmas Song" on a holiday
          recording of the Lindenhurst High School Choir in her senior year.
        </p>
        <p>
          She trained as a coloratura with plans to attend the Juilliard School,
          but decided instead to pursue health education at Stony Brook
          University. At 19, after one year at Stony Brook, she dropped out to
          marry her first husband, high school sweetheart Dennis Benatar, a U.S.
          Army draftee who trained at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, then served
          with the Army Security Agency at Fort Devens, Massachusetts, before
          being stationed at Fort Lee, Virginia, starting in 1973. She worked as
          a bank teller near Richmond, Virginia.

        <h4>Personal Life of Benetar</h4>
        <p>
          Benatar quit her job to pursue a singing career after being inspired
          by a Liza Minnelli concert she saw in Richmond. She had a gig at a
          Holiday Inn and got a job as a singing waitress at a nightclub named
          the Roaring Twenties.At the Roaring Twenties, she met and formed a duo
          with pianist Phil Coxon, which soon expanded to a ten-person lounge
          band called Coxon's Army, a regular at Sam Miller's basement club. The
          band gained in popularity and was the subject of a never-aired PBS
          special; its bassist Roger Capps was later the original bass player
          for the Pat Benatar Band. The period also yielded Benatar's first and
          only single until her eventual 1979 single (taken from the album In
          the Heat of the Night on Chrysalis Records): "Day Gig" (1974), Trace
          Records, written and produced by Coxon and locally released in
          Richmond. Her last significant gig in Richmond was a two-hour
          performance at Thomas Jefferson High School.

        <p>
          Halloween 1977 proved a pivotal night in her early, spandexed stage
          persona. She entered a Halloween contest at the Cafe Figaro in
          Greenwich Village dressed as a character from the film Cat-Women of
          the Moon. Later that evening, she went onstage at Catch a Rising Star
          still in costume. Between appearances at Catch a Rising Star, she
          recorded commercial jingles for Pepsi-Cola and a number of regional
          brands. She headlined New York City's Tramps nightclub over four days
          in spring 1978, where her performance was heard by representatives
          from several record companies. She was signed to Chrysalis Records by
          co-founder Terry Ellis the following week. She and Dennis divorced
          shortly after, although she kept his surname.

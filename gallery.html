          <strong>FAVORITE INSTRUMENT</strong>
          The guitar represents her love for making music with the instrument
          that got her into music itself. The band gained in popularity and was
          the subject of a never-aired PBS special; its bassist Roger Capps was
          later the original bass player for the Pat Benatar Band. The period
          also yielded Benatar's first and only single until her eventual 1979
          single (taken from the album In the Heat of the Night on Chrysalis
          Records): "

          <strong>MICROPHONE</strong>
          The microphone represents how much Mrs. Benatar enjoyed singing.
          Benatar quit her job to pursue a singing career after being inspired
          by a Liza Minnelli concert she saw in Richmond. She had a gig at a
          Holiday Inn and got a job as a singing waitress at a nightclub named
          the Roaring Twenties.

          <strong>GUITARS</strong>
          Mrs. Benatar had a collection of guitars that she preserved so dearly.
          She became interested in theater and began voice lessons, singing her
          first solo at the age of eight, at Daniel Street Elementary School, a
          song called "It Must Be Spring".[citation needed] At Lindenhurst
          Senior High School (1967â€“1970), she participated in musical theatre,
          playing Queen Guinevere in the school production of Camelot, marching
          in the homecoming parade, singing at the annual Christmas Tree
          Lighting ceremony, and performing a solo of "The Christmas Song" on a
          holiday recording of the Lindenhurst High School Choir in her senior
          year.

          She also enjoyed being one with nature and take nature walks to help
          her clear her mind when writing new music. Would often be inspired by
          Liza Minelli but most of the time nature played a huge role in the way
          she would produce music and make it tailored towards her fans
